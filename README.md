# CTA-Analysis
CTA transportation Analysis in Chicago
Examined a SQL Server database of CTA information to show the stations, stop, and ridership information. Utilized ADO.NET by using C# to execute SQL queries and show the outcomes. 
Additionally improved by isolating the database from the UI  to implement data-driven application techniques.
